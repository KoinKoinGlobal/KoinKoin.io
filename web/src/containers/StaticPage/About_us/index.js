								<p>
									We provide a secure, Lightningfast and seamless service at
									very low cost to individuals and small businesses across
									Africa who wish to benefit from the expediency of our
									cryptocurrency exchange services. Our easy to use e-wallet
									services allows you to convert and send your LOCAL currency
									into cryptocurrency which is accepted in many regions all over
									the world as a form of payment for your goods and services or
									for goods and services you wish to purchase from anywhere in
									the world where BTC and other cryptocurrencies are accepted.
									Whilst we aim to please our business customers, the KoinKoin
									platform is also powered to serve cryptocurrency speculators
									and intraday traders who simply wish to BUY, HOLD & TRADE
									cryptocurrencies. The KoinKoin platform provides exchange and
									Lightningfast execution services for an array of African Fiat
									including ZAR, NGN, GHS, UGX and KES as well as South East
									Asian Fiat including VND, MYR, IDR and THB and of course our
									virtual currencies to BTC (BitCoin), ETH (Ethereum), LTC
									(LiteCoin) & XRP (Ripple) with fast deposits and withdrawals.
									We also permit deposits in EUR and USD for those who are not
									based in Africa or South East Asia but wish to transact and
									complete business in these regions.
